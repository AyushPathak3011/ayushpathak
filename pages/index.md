Hey, I am Ayush Pathak, Working at Minimaly as a Full Stack Developer.<br>
I am also fascinated by Blockchain and Web 3.0 technologies, a fanatical open sourceror.<br>

I am a Computer Science Engineering freshman at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, India.<br>

Co-founder of Minimaly, a company that provides minimalistic web development and UI/UX design services to professionals all over the world.<br>

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects).

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing football and travelling. I am also a Formula 1 fanatic.<br>

If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Pune), maybe we can hang out and grab a coffee or code together.
